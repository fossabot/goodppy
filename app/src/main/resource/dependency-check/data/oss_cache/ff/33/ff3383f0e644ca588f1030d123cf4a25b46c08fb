When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.\n","cvssScore":5.3,"cvssVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","cwe":"CWE-125","cve":"CVE-2024-36124","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-36124?component-type\u003dmaven\u0026component-name\u003dorg.iq80.snappy%2Fsnappy\u0026utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d10.0.3","externalReferences":["http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\u003dCVE-2024-36124","https://github.com/dain/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-8wh2-6qhj-h7j9"]}],"sonatypeOssiScore":0.0}
